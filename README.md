# Anti-Crash-System
The main goal of the system is to reliably assure that the distance, in the Euclidean sense,
between any two given planes will be at least a specific threshold. 
In addition, the system will assure that the density of the planes in the given flight space is not high.
Clearly, the solution was developed efficient as possible.
