# Anti-Crash-System
This project was done in my first year studying Software Engineering during the course 'Data Structures'.
The main goal of the system is to reliably assure that the distance, in the Euclidean sense,
between any two given planes will be at least a specific threshold. In addition, the system will assure that the
density of the planes in the given flight space is not high. Clearly, your advised solution should be efficient as
possible.
